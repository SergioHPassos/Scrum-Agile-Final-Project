- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are a part of the agile software development to get an insight into the user needs from and end user perspective. It hurts to describe the software in simplified way. User stories can be captured from the end user on the client and other various stakeholders depending upon the following requirements. User stories just deviate from writing about the requirements to just discussion about it. It is basically a conversation between the client and the developer team. It reduces the time spent on writing large documentations as well as it also saves time in developing qualities software.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developer should have a clear-cut picture of what features it must incorporate and what should be averted. There must be a procedure of clear requirement gathering before any kind of software development process begins. After getting the requirements from the client the developer should decide software development model is best suited for the software to develop. These models include iterative, waterfall, prototype or agile model and others.

Agile software development process has many methods which are used in the software development among which some of them are scrum, feature driven development, extreme programming etc. Frequent inspection and adaptation are the major methodology which can be incorporated into an agile software development processes. It encourages accountability, teamwork and self-organization and it is aligned towards business approach which include customer in all development process.
